# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive redesign and performance optimization of both the creation (R1 client) and control panel applications. The primary goals are to eliminate memory leaks causing device overheating, implement a modern widget-based UI system with real-time customization capabilities, add swipe navigation for enhanced UX, and provide a developer-friendly widget kit for extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Performance Optimization and Memory Leak Resolution

**User Story:** As a user of the R1 applications, I want the apps to run efficiently without causing my device to overheat, so that I can use them for extended periods without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the creation app runs for more than 30 minutes THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable without continuous growth
2. WHEN the control panel operates with multiple devices THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 15% on average
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN connection cleanup SHALL occur properly on component unmount
4. WHEN real-time updates are received THEN event listeners SHALL be properly removed to prevent memory accumulation
5. IF memory usage exceeds 200MB THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection optimization
6. WHEN components re-render THEN unnecessary re-renders SHALL be prevented through proper memoization

### Requirement 2: Widget-Based UI Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want a customizable widget-based interface that allows me to arrange and configure different functional components according to my preferences, so that I can create a personalized workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the creation app THEN I SHALL see a grid-based widget layout system
2. WHEN I interact with widgets THEN they SHALL update in real-time without page refresh
3. WHEN I customize widget settings THEN changes SHALL persist across sessions
4. IF I add a new widget THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing widgets
5. WHEN widgets display data THEN updates SHALL occur with minimal latency
6. WHEN I resize widgets THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively

### Requirement 3: Swipe Navigation System

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to navigate between different sections of the app using intuitive swipe gestures, so that I can quickly access device management and activity information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I swipe right to left THEN I SHALL navigate to the device management page
2. WHEN I swipe left to right THEN I SHALL return to the main widget dashboard
3. WHEN I perform swipe gestures THEN navigation SHALL be smooth with appropriate animations
4. IF I swipe partially THEN the interface SHALL provide visual feedback and snap to the nearest page
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the current page indicator SHALL update accordingly
6. WHEN I use swipe navigation THEN it SHALL work consistently across different device sizes

### Requirement 4: Device Management Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dedicated interface for managing device ID, PIN settings, and viewing activity logs, so that I can monitor and control my R1 device configuration effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the device management page THEN I SHALL see current device ID and PIN status
2. WHEN I modify PIN settings THEN changes SHALL be applied immediately with confirmation
3. WHEN I view activity logs THEN they SHALL display in real-time with filtering options
4. IF I change device ID THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and update all references
5. WHEN I access device settings THEN the interface SHALL load within 2 seconds
6. WHEN I perform device management actions THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes

### Requirement 5: Widget Development Kit

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive widget development kit with clear APIs and documentation, so that I can create custom widgets that integrate seamlessly with the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new widget THEN I SHALL have access to standardized widget APIs
2. WHEN I develop widgets THEN I SHALL have TypeScript definitions for all interfaces
3. WHEN I register a widget THEN it SHALL appear in the widget selection interface
4. IF I create widget configurations THEN they SHALL be validated against defined schemas
5. WHEN widgets communicate THEN they SHALL use the provided event system
6. WHEN I package widgets THEN they SHALL follow the established plugin architecture

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Widget Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize widget appearance, behavior, and data sources through the control panel interface, so that I can tailor the experience to my specific needs without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access widget customization THEN I SHALL see a visual configuration interface
2. WHEN I modify widget properties THEN changes SHALL reflect immediately in the creation app
3. WHEN I configure data sources THEN widgets SHALL update their content accordingly
4. IF I create widget presets THEN they SHALL be available for quick application
5. WHEN I share widget configurations THEN other users SHALL be able to import them
6. WHEN I reset widget settings THEN they SHALL return to default configurations

### Requirement 7: Cross-Application Integration

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple R1 devices, I want seamless integration between the control panel and creation app, so that configuration changes and monitoring can be coordinated across both interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make changes in the control panel THEN they SHALL sync to the creation app in real-time
2. WHEN I monitor device status THEN information SHALL be consistent across both applications
3. WHEN I configure widgets in the control panel THEN they SHALL appear correctly in the creation app
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN both apps SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
5. WHEN I authenticate in one app THEN the session SHALL be shared with the other app
6. WHEN I update MCP configurations THEN widget data sources SHALL reflect the changes immediately
