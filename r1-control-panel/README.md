# R1 Control Panel

A modern React-based control panel for managing R1 devices and MCP servers.

## Features

- **ðŸ’¬ Chat Interface**: Test R1 devices with real-time messaging
- **ðŸ”Œ MCP Server Management**: Add, configure, and monitor MCP servers
- **ðŸ“± Device Management**: View and manage connected R1 devices
- **ðŸ”§ Debug Tools**: Real-time debug data and system monitoring

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The development server will start on `http://localhost:3000` and proxy API requests to the R-API server on port 5482.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the React app
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `build/` directory and can be served by the main R-API server.

## Components

- Filter by device and event type
- Export debug data for analysis

## API Integration

The control panel integrates with the R-API server through:

- REST API endpoints for CRUD operations
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Proxy configuration for development

## Styling
